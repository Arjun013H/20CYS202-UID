        “Anokha Techfest, the annual event of Amrita School of Engineering,
        Coimbatore provides an unique opportunity for students to participate in
        fun-filled and challenging events and workshops<br />The event throws
        open opportunities for students from all disciplines to challenge
        themselves and foster the “Can Do” attitude. One of the key highlights
        of the Anokha 2020 edition was the Green Anokha concept<br />It was so
        wonderful to see the students adopt and implement our Chancellor AMMA’s
        idea of “Living in Harmony with Nature”<br />It was plastic-free and
        eco-friendly Anokha – an initiative that will become a tradition!!”, Dr.
        Sasangan Ramanathan, Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa
